LottoApp
========

Just a simple app to simulate a lotto game. The nifty part is the "unique" random number generator, unique in
the sense that you can't have more than one of the same number in the 6 digit array (lotto numbers), After about 3 days 
of grappling with the problem, I was finally pointed to the solution! Eureka!!
